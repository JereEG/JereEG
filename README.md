***About me***

I'm in the final year of my Information Systems degree and live in Corrientes, Argentina. I'm passionate about technology and always willing to learn, explore, and love exploring how things work under the hood, especially in the areas of software development and computer science.

I'm currently focusing on improving my backend and frontend skills and enjoy working on projects that challenge my understanding and help me grow. I'm also delving into areas such as networking, computational methods, and systems architecture as part of my academic and personal development.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning:
  - Docker
  - AWS
  - React
- 👯 I'm excited to collaborate on educational, open source, or productivity projects.
- ✔ Ask me anything related to software development or computer systems; I'd love to help you or learn with you.
- 🎮 Outside of technology, I enjoy exploring ideas, studying excellent textbooks, and solving academic challenges.
- 📚 I am particularly curious about developing useful tools and understanding their inner workings.
